   * @class OverlappedProbabilisticModel
   * @brief A decorator class for probabilistic models that handles overlapping sequences.
   *
   * The OverlappedProbabilisticModel class extends the functionality of a base probabilistic model
   * by incorporating overlapping sequences. This class is designed to work with sequences that have
   * overlapping regions, allowing for more complex probabilistic evaluations and operations.
   *
   * @note This class inherits from ProbabilisticModelDecorator.
   *
   * @details
   * The class provides methods to evaluate the probabilistic model over a given sequence within a
   * specified range, choose sequences based on certain criteria, compute prefix sum arrays, and
   * initialize these arrays. It also includes methods to retrieve the model's parameters and name,
   * and to initialize the model with specific overlap and virtual size parameters.
   *
   * @var int OverlappedProbabilisticModel::_seqLength
   * The length of the sequence.
   *
   * @var int OverlappedProbabilisticModel::_left_overlap
   * The size of the left overlap.
   *
   * @var int OverlappedProbabilisticModel::_right_overlap
   * The size of the right overlap.
   *
   * @var int OverlappedProbabilisticModel::_model_virtual_size
   * The virtual size of the model.
   *
   * @var AlphabetPtr OverlappedProbabilisticModel::revAlphabet
   * A pointer to the reverse alphabet.
   *
   * @var DoubleVector OverlappedProbabilisticModel::_overlapped_sum_array
   * A vector to store the overlapped sum array.
   *
   * @fn OverlappedProbabilisticModel::OverlappedProbabilisticModel(ProbabilisticModelPtr m)
   * @brief Constructor that initializes the model with a given probabilistic model.
   * @param m A pointer to the base probabilistic model.
   *
   * @fn OverlappedProbabilisticModel::~OverlappedProbabilisticModel()
   * @brief Destructor for the OverlappedProbabilisticModel class.
   *
   * @fn double OverlappedProbabilisticModel::evaluate(const Sequence & s, unsigned int begin, unsigned int end) const
   * @brief Evaluates the probabilistic model over a given sequence within a specified range.
   * @param s The sequence to be evaluated.
   * @param begin The starting position of the range within the sequence.

   * @brief Chooses a sequence based on the given size.
   * @param h The sequence to be chosen.
   * @param size The size criteria for choosing the sequence.
   * @return The chosen sequence.
   *
   * @fn Sequence & OverlappedProbabilisticModel::choose(Sequence & h, int initial_phase, int size) const
   * @brief Chooses a sequence based on the given initial phase and size.
   * @param h The sequence to be chosen.
   * @param initial_phase The initial phase criteria for choosing the sequence.

   * @return The chosen sequence.
   *

   * @brief Computes the prefix sum array for the given range.
   * @param begin The starting position of the range.
   * @param end The ending position of the range.
   * @return The computed prefix sum as a double.
   *
   * @fn double OverlappedProbabilisticModel::prefix_sum_array_compute(int begin, int end, int phase)
   * @brief Computes the prefix sum array for the given range and phase.
   * @param begin The starting position of the range.
   * @param end The ending position of the range.
   * @param phase The phase for computing the prefix sum.
   * @return The computed prefix sum as a double.
